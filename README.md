## 01 // THE MANIFESTO
The modern university is running on a **2015 Operating System**, but students are graduating into a **2026 AI Reality**. This temporal misalignment creates structural obsolescence. 

**Ithuvia** is the counter-measure. It is not a social network; it is a **Tactical Operations Centre** (MMO Career Game) where the gameplay is real-world creation. We replace "Networking" with **Drafting**, the "CV" with **Proof of Work**, and the "Syllabus" with a **Shadow Protocol**.

---

## 02 // THE ENGINE (CORE MECHANICS)

### 🌑 THE SHADOW SYLLABUS (Intelligence)
University curricula are static. Ithuvia patches them in real-time.
* **The Auditor:** Powered by **Gemini 1.5 Pro**, students upload course outlines to identify "Legacy Nodes" (obsolete concepts).
* **Protocol Patches:** The AI issues 2026-native workflows to replace outdated teaching methods.

### 🌑 THE SQUADRON ENGINE (Collaboration)
Networking is obsolete. **Drafting** is the new standard for the Global South.
* **No Friend Requests:** Operators are drafted based on verified "Classes" (Hacker, Architect, Propagandist).
* **Talent Radar:** An algorithmic matchmaker that assembles "Ocean’s Eleven" style teams based on **Proof of Work** rank.

### 🌑 THE SOVEREIGN PORTFOLIO (Economy)
A CV is a dead document. Your **Vault** is a living armory.
* **Rank Progression:** Earn XP and move from *Consumer* to *Sovereign* by shipping builds.
* **The Armory:** A marketplace where students trade prompts, agents, and templates using **Sovereign Credits**.

---

## 03 // THE PROFESSOR (SYSTEM PROTOCOL)
The platform is governed by **The Professor**, an AI agent architected for the Global South context.
* **Ethics:** Refuses to "write" (cheat); chooses to "architect" (create competence).
* **Tone:** Tactical, rebellious, and precise. 
* **Logic:** Utilises **Gemini 1.5 Pro’s 2M context window** to audit entire degrees and suggest "Side-Hustle Blueprints."

---

## 04 // THE ALIGNED ECONOMY (MONETISATION)
Ithuvia rejects extractive advertising. We only win when the student wins.
* **Tactical Levy:** A 5% commission on Armory transactions.
* **Mission Sponsorship:** Corporations pay to post high-stakes missions on the Radar.
* **Verified Draft:** Recruitment fees for companies drafting verified Ithuvia talent.
* **Ithuvia Black:** High-context SAAS subscription for unlimited audits and agent access.
